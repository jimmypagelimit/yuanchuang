45. Showbiz! - MIKE

> When MIKE doesn’t glide as a rapper, he is a sputtering engine: coughing, snorting, humph-ing and haw-ing, until somehow, as if summoned, the hardest shit ever comes spilling out of him. Long a beacon for the morbidly depressed, his gravelly baritone has shifted with age—not the croak of a lost teenager, but the lived-in voice of a legend who has survived to tell the tale. That grown-up commandeers Showbiz!, an album whose supernatural skill is offset by the humble human at its center. “I ain’t no prophet, nigga,” MIKE raps, and it’s a shame: He sure does sound like one. –Samuel Hyland

> 当MIKE作为说唱歌手没有流畅地说唱时，他就像一台噼啪作响的发动机：咳嗽、嗤鼻、哼哧着，直到不知何故，仿佛被召唤一般，最硬核的内容从他口中倾泻而出。

> 

54. Showbiz! - MIKE

> Mike’s Showbiz! is a stellar glimpse into the human experience — 24 songs that offer a wide-ranging glimpse of the Brooklyn-based rhymer’s personal excavation over a variety of beats. On “Watered down,” he admits, “I get hotheaded and mean sometimes, my fault, forgive me” over a chipper, high-pitches sample. “Man in the mirror” shows him rhyming over an upbeat dance track, while “When it Rains” has a groove that harkens to his excellent Pinball series with producer Tony Seltzer. There aren’t many artists as vulnerable as Mike, and even fewer craft their reflections with his technical precision. —A.G.

42	EUSEXUA	FKA twigs

> In its original form, the eleven songs on EUSEXUA navigate ideas of anticipation, indecision, shifting interpersonal independence. “We’re open wounds/Just bleeding out the pressure,” FKA twigs declares on the backroom anthem “Room of Fools.” Dancing is one way to do this; sex is another; knowing when to be alone, a third. All are unstable, but twigs embodies these strategies across big tent floor-fillers spanning Eurotrance, jungle, and rave. The album edges listeners through what would be climaxes in lesser hands. “Striptease” has at least three of them; the first minute of “Drums of Death” out-sizzles entire careers of other electro-sleaze producers and then moves on. The fluid truth of EUSEXUA is that wounds don’t close, but like the best dancefloors, you can keep finding new ways in and out of them. –Jesse Dorris
> 「我们是敞开的伤口/只是在释放压力，」FKA twigs在这首幕后圣歌《Room of Fools》中宣告。跳舞是一种方式；性是另一种；知道何时独处，是第三种。

11  EUSEXUA FKA twigs

> FKA Twigs mashes up techno beats, house production, and unforgiving industrial tones, creating a space that she’s described as “so euphoric” that one could “transcend human form.” —J.L.
> 特威格斯将电子节拍（techno beats）、浩室制作（house production）和无情的工业音调（industrial tones）融合在一起，创造出一个她所描述的“如此令人狂喜”以至于可以“超越人类形态”的空间。——J.L.

36	moisturizer	Wet Leg

> Maybe that 80-quid pot of Drunk Elephant really can save you: moisturizer totally transformed Wet Leg, turning the Isle of Wight five-piece into a band as funny, acerbic, and clever as NME always said they were. The primary fuel for this album was frontwoman Rhian Teasdale discovering she was queer and, subsequently, falling in love, and it finds endless joy, tension, and entertainment in those things: “catch these fists” and “mangetout” gleefully turn the epithet “man-hating lesbian” into a badge of honor; “jennifer’s body” and “davina mccall” make having a crush sound as sweaty and intense as it actually is, while “pillow talk” is so horned-up that it would make most self-professed gooners blush. That track gets to the core message of moisturizer: Fake freaks need not apply. –Shaad D’Souza

> 《moisturizer》彻底改变了Wet Leg乐队，将这支来自怀特岛的五人乐队转变为一支正如NME一直所说的那样有趣、尖刻且聪明的乐队。

63  moisturizer Wet Leg

> U.K. indie rockers Wet Leg came out of nowhere in 2021 to become bona fide international superstars. On their second album, they prove they’ve been partying harder, traveling faster, caring less, and meeting sexier idiots. If you thought they might catch a case of sophomore-slump neurosis after their self-titled debut, you guessed wrong. Moisturizer keeps everything fast and frisky, ranging from crushed-out bliss (“I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”) to breakup rage (“You are washed-up, irrelevant, and standing in my light”). But wherever Wet Leg go, they make you want to tag along. —R.S.

> 在他们的第二张专辑中，他们证明了自己一直在更尽情地派对、更快地旅行、更少地在意，以及遇到更性感的白痴。

35	MUSIC	Playboi Carti

> Where do you go after pushing Yeezus’ hip-hop-meets-noise provocation to its logical conclusion, birthing an entire subgenre of rap and stoking years of frenzied anticipation? Playboi Carti’s answer was to go wide. MUSIC contains a multitude of Cartis: the elastic-voiced goon (“LIKE WEEZY”), the spiritual descendant of Wayne (“RADAR”), the deep-voiced Future acolyte (“DIS 1 GOT IT”). Carti reaches for the stars on this record but seems equally content playing to the experimental underground. MUSIC demonstrates that Carti can speak to the center and the periphery of pop culture simultaneously. –Mehan Jayasuriya

> Carti在这张专辑中追求星光璀璨的主流成功，但似乎同样满足于为实验性的地下音乐圈表演。

10  MUSIC   Playboi Carti

> The Atlanta rapper’s 2020 album, Whole Lotta Red, is a foundational text for dozens if not hundreds of extremely online acts. With Music, Playboi Carti seems decidedly aware of his potential as a generational talent. There are a handful of moments where synthesized washes burble and soar, the net effect of arena lights splashing onto a crowd of thousands. As Carti stands on the mountaintop, he finds himself looking back at his journey as well as admiring the view and puzzling over his inevitable descent. Even when he slips into an uninspired chant or exhausts with his monomaniacal focus on drugs, women, cars, and taunting opps, he still magnetizes as a unique pop star. —M.R

> 凭借《Music》专辑，Playboi Carti似乎明确意识到自己作为"世代天才"的潜力。

23	Headlights Alex G

> On Headlights, Alex G surveys the iconography of his past work from the other side of 30 years old and a major label deal. In the process, he recovers the pieces of himself that had always loomed beneath the surface to construct his first true self-portrait. The lifelong Philly resident writes explicitly from his own perspective, putting the idealistic dreams of his youth and the character sketches of his old records in conversation with his present self: a new father and reluctant "career" musician. It's a well-navigated turn toward greater vulnerability that comes alongside his prettiest songwriting yet. And, fortunately, his newfound maturity hasn't stifled his eccentric impulses. "Bounce Boy" fully realizes his past experiments with Auto-Tune and hyperpop-adjacent electronica, while tracks on the record's final stretch look to The Muppet Movie and Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts scores to generate Headlights' most tender moments. On "Is It Still You in There?" a children's choir asks the titular question as jazzy keys float by. Despite the world-weariness and disillusionment that come with growing older, Alex G is still the same dreamer that he's always been, with glimmers of optimism and awe beckoning around every corner of the record. –Jude Noel

> 《Headlights》专辑中，30岁且已签约主流唱片公司的Alex G审视着自己过往作品中的标志性元素。在这个过程中，他重新找回了一直潜藏在表面之下的自我碎片，构建出自己的第一幅真实自画像。


52  Headlights Alex G

> Alex Giannascoli was one of the first and finest acts to break through in the 2010s by posting his home-recorded music straight to Bandcamp, and his tried-and-true methods haven’t stopped yielding uncannily compelling results. On his first album for a major label, his ability to create a sound that feels at once magical and lived-in remains remarkable, like whole histories of folk and rock music are expressing themselves through this one chill guy. Whether you’ve been riding with him for years or you’re thinking of joining up today, Headlights is an album that won’t make you regret that choice. —S.V.L.

> 在他签约主流唱片公司的首张专辑中，他创造出既富有魔力又真实亲切的声音的能力依然非凡，仿佛整个民谣和摇滚音乐的历史都通过这个冷静的家伙表达出来。

21	GOLLIWOG	billy woods

> Each song on billy woods’ GOLLIWOG unfolds with the knowledge that death, or perhaps a fate worse than, waits behind every corner. His characters stare up at planes as bomb hatches swing open, or wake from nightmares, only to find themselves trapped in coffins. They’re threatened by vampires, soulless record executives, corrupt politicians, abusive fathers, and the American military apparatus, and woods cleverly constructs the moments where they know it’s all fucked. He’s approached this subject matter throughout his career, but rarely sustains that bullet-sweating, white knuckle tension for an entire LP. Here, he writes like an amalgam of Shirley Jackson, Mariana Enríquez, and Frank B. Wilderson III, crafting a speculative opus titled mere degrees from our reality. It’s harrowing and horrific, the cathartic laughter after the jump scare catching in our throats. –Dash Lewis

> 在billy woods的专辑《GOLLIWOG》中，每首歌都带着这样一种认知展开：死亡，或者可能更糟的命运，潜伏在每个角落。

17  GOLLIWOG    billy woods

> Billy Woods rose out of the Brooklyn rap underground as a virtuoso poet, one of hip-hop’s most independent and brilliant minds over the past two decades. On Golliwog, he goes for an album full of horror stories. It’s a densely poetic, totally masterful tour de force where Woods lets his expansive imagination run loose in a dystopia where the real-life monsters are scarier than anything he could invent. Golliwog is a horror show that demands — and replays — close attention. But it’s an album that offers no comfort — for Woods, the monsters are everywhere, and survival means keeping on your toes. —R.S.

> Billy Woods 作为一位技艺精湛的诗人从布鲁克林说唱地下圈崭露头角，是过去二十年来嘻哈界最具独立性和才华横溢的人物之一

18	Fancy That	PinkPantheress

> Like many girls who came of age in the aughts and early 2010s, PinkPantheress spent plenty of time reading fan fiction. A classic Pink track feels like it could have been lifted straight from a self-insert, the kind where the protagonist meticulously shaves her entire body on the off chance that she’s invited backstage to hook up with the band. On her second album, Fancy That, she’s evolved from brooding over unrequited love atop breakbeats to embracing a much more flirtatious and forward tone. “Come talk to me. Do you want sex with me?” she whispers on “Tonight.” You can almost picture her twirling a fluffy pastel gel pen, feet kicking in the air, as she writes in her glittery Girl Tech Password-protected journal.

> 一首经典的PinkPantheress曲目感觉就像直接从一部自我代入的同人小说中摘出来的，那种主角会一丝不苟地剃光全身，万一有机会被邀请到后台与乐队勾搭。

23  Fancy That  PinkPantheress

> Pinkpantheress takes a quick spin through the club on the 20-minute Fancy That, drawing energy from turn-of-the century British bangers, and the sort of brazen sampling that made hip-hop and dance music so exciting back in the day. Basement Jaxx disco-funk stomper “Romeo” gets flipped on “Girl Like Me,” and Jaxx DNA appears elsewhere on the mixtape. Elsewhere, Fancy That chops up Jessica Simpson and Panic! at the Disco and teams Victoria Walker up with “indie-sleaze” brat the Dare on “Stateside.” The upshot is nine crispy song nuggets that don’t overstay or overshare. —W.H.  

> Pinkpantheress在这张20分钟的《Fancy That》中快速穿梭于俱乐部场景，从世纪之交的英国热门歌曲以及那种让嘻哈和舞曲在当年如此激动人心的大胆采样中汲取能量。

16	LUX	Rosalía

> In Gravity and Grace, the philosopher and Catholic mystic Simone Weil writes of God’s love as fundamentally unknowable; an abstract totality who loves us but whom we can only embrace in the dark. Rosalía’s album LUX is a modern inquiry into that darkness, a sacred and profane fusion of pop and classical music that approaches timeless spiritual questions through the lens of a modern seeker. Guided by a rogues’ gallery of female saints and holy women, the singer probes into love, desire, and eternity, sampling a broad palette of genres and tongues to illuminate distinct aspects of the soul. Even if her resolve to cast off her Jimmy Choos in “Sauvignon Blanc” isn’t as mortifying as anything Teresa of Avila or Catherine of Siena got up to (don’t look it up), the gift of LUX is the little light Rosalía shines on life’s greatest mysteries. –Harry Tafoya

> 罗莎莉亚的专辑《LUX》是对上帝的爱的现代探索，它是流行音乐和古典音乐的神圣与世俗融合，通过现代探索者的视角探讨永恒的精神问题。

3   LUX ROSALÍA

> Rosalía has proven herself to be pop’s most provocative chaos agent, and Lux sounds like absolutely nothing else in music right now. Her irreverence is what makes the album such a shock to the system — she’s drawing from the greats but going for Mozart with baddie energy, Bach with a blunt in the mouth. Ultimately, the album succeeds because every song is deeply thought out and wildly heartfelt, tying back to heady ideas of what the hell we’re all doing here. She contends with pain and loss, anger and grief, sex and desire, love and worship, while trying to get a better understanding of who she is, the way she loves, and the spiritual forces that move her. —J.L.

> 她借鉴了伟大作曲家的作品，却以"坏女孩"的能量演绎莫扎特，让巴赫嘴里叼着大麻。

> Addison Rae overcame being the most popular TikTok dancer to become one of the less popular new pop stars, and as soon as we realized she meant it, we were all in. I saw her come out at Madison Square Garden with Charli XCX in the fevered months post-BRAT and she did not hit that note, but literally no one cares anymore because Addison is this year’s most stylishly indexed and tonally refined pure pop album. “Diet Pepsi” is irresistible. “High Fashion” is camp. Happiness equals one shitty pair of wired earbuds and one cigarette. Louisiana’s sweetheart and her Scandinavian pop wizards (production duo Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd) make it look so easy: no features, no skips, no deluxe editions. This is how It Girls are born. –Anna Gaca

12  Addison Addison Rae

> When Addison Rae was ascending on TikTok with viral dances and beauty deals, the millions that followed her may have never anticipated where she would be five years later. But Rae has become an expert at reminding people to expect the unexpected. Her self-titled debut is energetic and inventive, a true pop fan’s pop album. With touches of Ray of Light Madonna and In the Zone Britney Spears, Addison is meant to get you moving. But it’s the moments she lets you in that help the album shine more brightly, like the nods to family discord and anxiety that peek out of “Times Like These” and “Headphones On.” —B.S.

10	Black Star	Amaarae

> There’s a fair amount of sex, drugs, and Young Thug flows on Fountain Baby, Amaarae’s 2023 crystalline dance pop triumph, but Black Star is all sex, drugs, and Young Thug flows. Instead of coasting right into the slot as one of the next pop girls, she blows it all up for a frenetic, ridiculously horny, drugged-out document of self-indulgent partying and not giving a single fuck. Wildly repurposing old pop-rap radio hits, using massive levels of pitch manipulation, and weaving big, glossy spins on rave-ready techno, Brazilian funk, and Jersey club into her Afrobeats foundation, Black Star is a loud and abrasive, incohesive, and out of pocket (c’mon she’s out here riding around in Waymos and comparing her balcony sex to Ruff Ryders rapper Drag-On) romp through the Black diaspora.

I’d understand if you get the itch to compare Black Star to the other ambitious, studied, and dot-connecting pop staples of the recent past. But the truth is that it’s way riskier, more in conversation with the sex-crazed club pop of France’s Theodora and the disruptive 2010s Atlanta homage of Playboi Carti’s MUSIC. By calling her album Black Star and inserting herself on the cover as the black star on the flag of her native Ghana, the record comes with the expectations to not just make a fun Amaarae album but to do justice to that ideological framing. Yet the album feels light and pressure-free, going full steam ahead with ideas that are still taboo in a lot of Black immigrant circles that tend to lean religious—all the coke and ketamine of “Starkilla,” the casualness to how she claims, “My bitch and my nigga the same sex” on “ms60.” She might be the boldest pop star we have right now. –Alphonse Pierre

> 她没有顺理成章地成为下一批流行女孩中的一员，而是将这一切炸开，创造出一份狂热、极度色情、迷幻的记录，记录了自我放纵的派对和毫不在乎的态度

37  BLACK STAR  Amaarae

> On her third album, boundary-busting singer Amaarae dives straight into the club. From the stalagmite synths of leadoff track “Stuck Up,” Black Star is a sweaty, lusty thrill ride with Amaarae firmly in control of the pleasure sensors — for her and for any amorous targets she might pick up. Bringing along a VVIP list of guests — among them bedroom auteur PinkPantheress, funk legend Charlie Wilson, and hyperpop visionary Bree Runway — she whirls through dance music’s past and future with bravado and bluster. —M. Johnston

9	The Passionate Ones	Nourished by Time

> Let’s say John Bagot Glubb was right, and the average empire does take 250 years to fall—we’ll be cooked by next year. But the anticipatory dread has been permeating in American minds for decades. Marcus Brown of Nourished by Time has spent his career basking in it, pointing towards the Doomsday Clock like the crazed bearded nigga on the block yelling about The Rapture. The Passionate Ones, Brown’s potent, irresistibly dancey second album, gestures towards this collapse not through political hand-wringing, but through his intense longing for intimacy despite it. “Low on money/Quite high on passion,” he spits on “BABY BABY,” and the latter comes through wholeheartedly: The wonky iridescence of “Idiot in the Park,” the gospel-tinged freakout of “Crazy People,” the sheer singalongability of “The Passionate Ones.” No skips in sight.

In a parallel, more just reality, “9 2 5” would stand tall as a chart-topping, generation-defining hit. Even more distinct than Brown’s fluorescent synths and hip-swinging percussion is how much that warbling voice of his carries. “Oh brother, it’s a hateful life/And ya got two choices, either left or right,” he sings, pausing a bit for a jovial breakdown. “He’s freakin’ the 9-to-5.” That this album’s smooth meld of dance punk, disco, rap, and R&B never halts itself to drive its message home is crucial. I’ll still be dancing to it once the shit hits the fan. –Olivier Lafontant


42  The Passionate Ones Nourished By Time

> Marcus Brown is the sly R&B auteur who goes by Nourished by Time, from Brooklyn via Baltimore and Berklee. He turned heads in 2023 with his debut, Erotic Probiotic 2, but he aims even higher with the ambitiously high-strung futuristic soul of The Passionate Ones. It’s playful yet elegiac, as in the house beats of “9 2 5,” hyped up into an obsessive portrait of getting eaten alive by your day job, or the sped-up Labi Siffre vocal chirp that hooks the glam rock “Max Potential.” In “Baby Baby,” he teams up with British rapper Tony Bontana to shred capitalism. —R.S.

7	Getting Killed	Geese

> Crossover albums often come fully formed, as if the songwriter’s pop bona fides were just destined to materialize there and then. Geese’s third album, Getting Killed, is nothing like that at all. The New York quartet’s music is—and has become—huge in spite of itself. Winter’s soulful charms are odd and insidious, persistent like a problem that nobody knows what to do with. And like a problem, Getting Killed asserts its upside-down reality upon you—a reality where Winter, rocking on a rocking chair, is well within his rights to look up from his poetry book and ribbit a line like, “You can’t keep womankind in your dreams,” and you will take it, and you will want him to do it again.

Getting Killed is tapped into a universal consciousness, but not the illuminated, Alice Coltrane kind. It is the kind that never shuts up, that makes you want to tap out before it kills your spirit. Maybe this is why Winter is “trying to talk over everybody in the world” on the title track, or why he seems to be speaking generationally when he adds, “I can’t even taste my own tears/They fall into an even sadder bastard’s eyes.” It is probably why, in any case, Geese seek a bit of jouissance, a flare of Beefheart-at-Stax abandon. Getting Killed diverts art rock through the dirt-lined grooves of jam music and Allen Toussaint to arrive at a transcendental vagueness that encompasses mind and body, navel-gazing and insurrection. It does not have good advice—it may not have a worldview—but it has the desire and the means to leave you utterly insensible. –Jazz Monroe

5   Getting Killed  Geese

> The idea of rock music being “taken in a new direction” seems like a pretty strained concept in 2025. But then here come Geese with their incredibly original third album, taking rock music apart and jamming it back together again into something bracing and anxious and smilingly strange. Every song teems with unsettled discovery — from the warped soft-rock slow dance “Cobra” to the clattering, hymn-like luster of “Taxes” to the gut-punch boogie of “Bow Down.” “You can be free,” Cameron Winter moans without a hint of irony. If you can be as free as these guys, you’re doing pretty great. —J.D.

6	Bleeds	Wednesday

> Eight years in, Wednesday finally know who they are: proud North Carolinians, trusted friends nursing tired hearts, busybodies who need a soda break. After a decade of shoehorning Americana into shoegaze, Wednesday emerged as the preeminent kingpin of the genre they pioneered, the self-described “creek rock.” On Bleeds, their sixth studio album, Wednesday sprawl out in grunge crescendos and lap steel breezes, more comfortable than their desperate wailing suggests. It’s the sound of complete self-discovery.

And yet Bleeds ceases to sit still. Singer-guitarist Karly Hartzman writes with the attention to detail and empathetic eye of a poet laureate thrice her senior—and not just in song. She extracts profundity from a pitbull puppy peeing off a balcony, a tooth cracking on a cough drop, or driving someone to the airport with the handbrake on. Even when recounting the now-deceased ex who circulated her nudes or fighting off sobs tracking “The Way Love Goes,” she twists the faucet of shame, dread, and anxiety until something resembling forgiveness drips out. Knowing yourself gives you tools to live, but life keeps upping the pace as always. –Nina Corcoran

8   Bleeds  Wednesday

> “You sent my nudes around/I never yelled at you about it ’cause you died,” Karly Hartzman sings on ‘Townies,” delivering one of many startlingly great lines on Wednesday’s sixth album. Bleeds still contains elements of the North Carolina band’s original fuzzy, feral shoegaze sound, but there’s also sublime creek rock, like the beautiful banger “Wound Up Here (By Holding On),” and the honeyed ballad “Elderberry Wine.” These shifting sonic landscapes, combined with Hartzman’s fearless, razor-sharp lyrics, make for a wild Southern gothic odyssey — one you’ll willingly take again and again, regardless of how dark it gets. —A.M.

5	DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS	Bad Bunny

> Watching DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS unfold felt less like following an album cycle and more like enrolling in a year-long crash course on Puerto Rico. Proudly sporting the pava—the campesino hat of the island’s rural working class—Benito drags that symbol into every song, visual, and public appearance, parading around the world as both patron saint and chronicler of Puerto Rican music, art, aesthetics, and politics. The record’s sprawl—salsa, bomba, plena, bolero, old‑school perreo, house, and glossy urbano—hits like a powerful alcolado for a festering wound. The culprit? The ghosts of global imperialism. “I can’t forget you/You taught me how to love/Taught me to dance” the choir chants on album centerpiece “BAILE INoLVIDABLE.” He's not really singing to a lover, but speaking directly to la isla.

1   DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS    Bad Bunny

> On his sixth album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos, Bad Bunny brings listeners along for his triumphant homecoming with 17 songs that traverse Puerto Rico’s rich kaleidoscope of genres. It’s homegrown, jubilant, and fresh as Benito takes the best moments from Un Verano Sin Ti and pushes the limits of his continuously experimental sound into the unchartered territory of Puerto Rican folk music and salsa. Despite its hyper-specific cultural focus, or maybe because of it, Debí Tirar Más Fotos conquered 2025. It could be heard on the streets of New York, San Juan, and beyond — and helped Bad Bunny make history. The star became the first to host a residency at Puerto Rico’s El Choli, and he will bring the No Quiero Ir De Aqui Tour to the global stage in 2026, stopping to headline the Super Bowl halftime show and maybe even pick up one of the six Grammy nominations he’s up for along the way. The album and its dominance this year are a testament of where unwavering Borican pride can take Bad Bunny. —M.G.

4	choke enough	Oklou

> Like fuzzy memories, swaths of choke enough blot out the details and train you to make them out. Here’s one example: Oklou will often play the coolest arpeggio on a keyboard you’ve ever heard, then shove it all the way back, like you’re hearing it through a wall, nurturing it in a bed of pads and percussion and giving it space to bloom. You often hear melodies so soft and faint in the mix that they’re abstracted away from the physical textures of instruments. Tapping into the innocence of Bach preludes, they can feel like exercises in counterpoint, pure and classical and technically precise.

The runaway success of choke enough this year suggests a quiet revolution in pop music, a reorienting around the worlds that can be created and explored across albums. In the margins, drifting throughout, is Oklou’s voice, nimble and sprite-like, conjuring images of ice cream trucks and “blade birds” in the French artist’s second language. Her hooks are these slight, porous little things that sometimes spiral out in lockstep with those arpeggios, enveloping your mind like mushroom colonies. –Mano Sundaresan

47  choke enough    Oklou

> The debut album from avant-pop favorite Oklou is steeped in bleepy-bloop romanticism. The French musician (real name Marylou Mayniel) does wondrous things with synth loops and her plucked-from-the-heavens vocals, gesturing to myriad realms of electronic and pop music, as much as her classical training and regional French folklore. The result is a wonderland that often feels pixelated and impressionistic but never far from the natural world. Oklou reaches crystalline peaks on closer “Blade Bird” and “Take Me By the Hand,” a duet with Drain Gang’s Bladee that confronts uncertainty and anxiety with the clarity of touch. —Jon Blistein

3	Heavy Metal	Cameron Winter

> Heavy Metal was almost shelved. It was not commercial enough, was the label’s thinking. It was going to fail. But then it didn’t. In fact, it has made its author, Cameron Winter, into a somewhat unlikely star. Heavy Metal is a weird, gorgeous, vast, and tricky record. A song like “$0,” with its many allusions to God, and whether or not he is “actually for real,” is not exactly Top 40 fodder. “Nina + Field of Cops,” is like if you set an Anne Sexton poem to a Vyvanse prescription. The hook on “Drinking Age,” a piano ballad, is, “I met who I’m gonna be from now on/And he’s a piece of shit.”

But pieced together, Heavy Metal swirls itself into a tremendous rock record. If you were to pin down its central conceit, it would be something like: Love can transform you. God can transform you. Art can transform you. And all of these things are actually the same thing. Case in point: “Love Takes Miles.” Here, Winter is singing in declarations. Love, he muses, can make you fit it all in the car! It makes the lights brighter! It takes miles and it takes years, just to get it right. To get it really good. There are moments on Heavy Metal where Winter is Jeff Mangum when he sings about how having sex can Ruin Your Life. Elliott Smith exclusively when he’s playing keys, and Nick Drake with his pink, pink, pink moon. But more often than not, he’s just Cameron Winter. And that in and of itself, is a miracle. –Sophie Kemp

32  Heavy Metal Cameron Winter

> Geese frontman Cameron Winter released his sleeper debut in late 2024, about nine months before his band’s excellent Getting Killed became one of the year’s breakout rock albums. On Heavy Metal, he shows a Harry Nilsson-esque knack for coaxing the weird from the poignant, and vice versa. The Seventies pop-rock palette clatters as it grooves, wobbles as it swoons, while Winter flexes his baritone from strung out and weary to high-wire alive. He courts destruction and love, disillusionment and transcendence, with awe, sincerity, incredulity, and suspicion. —J. Blistein

2	Baby	Dijon

> Dijon’s Baby is an overindulgent collagist fantasy. There are simple drum machines, providing enough thumps and thuds to shake a family portrait off the wall. There are Prince-esque yelps, so you know how good the sex is. There’s a humorous royalty-free baby whine, so you know what good sex leads to. Settling down suggests a newfound restraint that comes with domesticity, but I think Dijon would beg to differ. Every song on Baby feels like it could explode at any second—his mostly unintelligible croons about his kin are drenched under layers of distortion and compression, surrounded by rattling instruments. On “(Referee),” just thinking about his wife’s demeanor and the way she carries herself is enough to make his words come out all jumbled (“Amen! Say when! Sermon! Semen!”). How Dijon balances the tension between his reserved songwriting and the theatricality of everything else makes Baby the most sincere devotional album in recent memory: Here’s a man who wants to proclaim his love as loud as possible but knows that the best things should be kept close to the chest. –Rae-Aila Crumble

4   Baby    Dijon

> Dijon’s music has elastic relationship to time and place, surfing between eras, genres, and moods, creating something as kaleidoscopic as it is familiar. Throughout his second album, fragments of sounds — fiery ad-libs, golden age hip-hop samples, whizzing, inverted vocal riffs — jut out like beams of light piercing through the pitch black of night. Baby is indeed best described by that all-encompassing word, experimental, but Dijon can occupy a space closer to traditional R&B too, concluding “Kindalove” with a thematic summation: “When I need it you shock me with your love!” he belts, having just done the same to us. —J.I.
