54. Showbiz! - MIKE

> Mike’s Showbiz! is a stellar glimpse into the human experience — 24 songs that offer a wide-ranging glimpse of the Brooklyn-based rhymer’s personal excavation over a variety of beats. On “Watered down,” he admits, “I get hotheaded and mean sometimes, my fault, forgive me” over a chipper, high-pitches sample. “Man in the mirror” shows him rhyming over an upbeat dance track, while “When it Rains” has a groove that harkens to his excellent Pinball series with producer Tony Seltzer. There aren’t many artists as vulnerable as Mike, and even fewer craft their reflections with his technical precision. —A.G.
> MIKE的《Showbiz!》是对人类体验的精彩一瞥——24首歌曲通过各种节奏，广泛展现了这位布鲁克林说唱歌手的个人探索。
