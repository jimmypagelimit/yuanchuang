45. Showbiz! - MIKE

> When MIKE doesn’t glide as a rapper, he is a sputtering engine: coughing, snorting, humph-ing and haw-ing, until somehow, as if summoned, the hardest shit ever comes spilling out of him. Long a beacon for the morbidly depressed, his gravelly baritone has shifted with age—not the croak of a lost teenager, but the lived-in voice of a legend who has survived to tell the tale. That grown-up commandeers Showbiz!, an album whose supernatural skill is offset by the humble human at its center. “I ain’t no prophet, nigga,” MIKE raps, and it’s a shame: He sure does sound like one. –Samuel Hyland

> 

54. Showbiz! - MIKE

> Mike’s Showbiz! is a stellar glimpse into the human experience — 24 songs that offer a wide-ranging glimpse of the Brooklyn-based rhymer’s personal excavation over a variety of beats. On “Watered down,” he admits, “I get hotheaded and mean sometimes, my fault, forgive me” over a chipper, high-pitches sample. “Man in the mirror” shows him rhyming over an upbeat dance track, while “When it Rains” has a groove that harkens to his excellent Pinball series with producer Tony Seltzer. There aren’t many artists as vulnerable as Mike, and even fewer craft their reflections with his technical precision. —A.G.

42	EUSEXUA	FKA twigs

> In its original form, the eleven songs on EUSEXUA navigate ideas of anticipation, indecision, shifting interpersonal independence. “We’re open wounds/Just bleeding out the pressure,” FKA twigs declares on the backroom anthem “Room of Fools.” Dancing is one way to do this; sex is another; knowing when to be alone, a third. All are unstable, but twigs embodies these strategies across big tent floor-fillers spanning Eurotrance, jungle, and rave. The album edges listeners through what would be climaxes in lesser hands. “Striptease” has at least three of them; the first minute of “Drums of Death” out-sizzles entire careers of other electro-sleaze producers and then moves on. The fluid truth of EUSEXUA is that wounds don’t close, but like the best dancefloors, you can keep finding new ways in and out of them. –Jesse Dorris

> FKA Twigs mashes up techno beats, house production, and unforgiving industrial tones, creating a space that she’s described as “so euphoric” that one could “transcend human form.” —J.L.
> 特威格斯将电子节拍（techno beats）、浩室制作（house production）和无情的工业音调（industrial tones）融合在一起，创造出一个她所描述的“如此令人狂喜”以至于可以“超越人类形态”的空间。——J.L.

36	moisturizer	Wet Leg

> Maybe that 80-quid pot of Drunk Elephant really can save you: moisturizer totally transformed Wet Leg, turning the Isle of Wight five-piece into a band as funny, acerbic, and clever as NME always said they were. The primary fuel for this album was frontwoman Rhian Teasdale discovering she was queer and, subsequently, falling in love, and it finds endless joy, tension, and entertainment in those things: “catch these fists” and “mangetout” gleefully turn the epithet “man-hating lesbian” into a badge of honor; “jennifer’s body” and “davina mccall” make having a crush sound as sweaty and intense as it actually is, while “pillow talk” is so horned-up that it would make most self-professed gooners blush. That track gets to the core message of moisturizer: Fake freaks need not apply. –Shaad D’Souza

63  moisturizer Wet Leg

> U.K. indie rockers Wet Leg came out of nowhere in 2021 to become bona fide international superstars. On their second album, they prove they’ve been partying harder, traveling faster, caring less, and meeting sexier idiots. If you thought they might catch a case of sophomore-slump neurosis after their self-titled debut, you guessed wrong. Moisturizer keeps everything fast and frisky, ranging from crushed-out bliss (“I’ll be your Shakira, whenever, wherever”) to breakup rage (“You are washed-up, irrelevant, and standing in my light”). But wherever Wet Leg go, they make you want to tag along. —R.S.

35	MUSIC	Playboi Carti

> Where do you go after pushing Yeezus’ hip-hop-meets-noise provocation to its logical conclusion, birthing an entire subgenre of rap and stoking years of frenzied anticipation? Playboi Carti’s answer was to go wide. MUSIC contains a multitude of Cartis: the elastic-voiced goon (“LIKE WEEZY”), the spiritual descendant of Wayne (“RADAR”), the deep-voiced Future acolyte (“DIS 1 GOT IT”). Carti reaches for the stars on this record but seems equally content playing to the experimental underground. MUSIC demonstrates that Carti can speak to the center and the periphery of pop culture simultaneously. –Mehan Jayasuriya

10  MUSIC   Playboi Carti

> The Atlanta rapper’s 2020 album, Whole Lotta Red, is a foundational text for dozens if not hundreds of extremely online acts. With Music, Playboi Carti seems decidedly aware of his potential as a generational talent. There are a handful of moments where synthesized washes burble and soar, the net effect of arena lights splashing onto a crowd of thousands. As Carti stands on the mountaintop, he finds himself looking back at his journey as well as admiring the view and puzzling over his inevitable descent. Even when he slips into an uninspired chant or exhausts with his monomaniacal focus on drugs, women, cars, and taunting opps, he still magnetizes as a unique pop star. —M.R

23	Headlights Alex G

> On Headlights, Alex G surveys the iconography of his past work from the other side of 30 years old and a major label deal. In the process, he recovers the pieces of himself that had always loomed beneath the surface to construct his first true self-portrait. The lifelong Philly resident writes explicitly from his own perspective, putting the idealistic dreams of his youth and the character sketches of his old records in conversation with his present self: a new father and reluctant “career” musician. It’s a well-navigated turn toward greater vulnerability that comes alongside his prettiest songwriting yet. And, fortunately, his newfound maturity hasn’t stifled his eccentric impulses. “Bounce Boy” fully realizes his past experiments with Auto-Tune and hyperpop-adjacent electronica, while tracks on the record’s final stretch look to The Muppet Movie and Vince Guaraldi’s Peanuts scores to generate Headlights’ most tender moments. On “Is It Still You in There?” a children’s choir asks the titular question as jazzy keys float by. Despite the world-weariness and disillusionment that come with growing older, Alex G is still the same dreamer that he’s always been, with glimmers of optimism and awe beckoning around every corner of the record. –Jude Noel

52  Headlights Alex G

> Alex Giannascoli was one of the first and finest acts to break through in the 2010s by posting his home-recorded music straight to Bandcamp, and his tried-and-true methods haven’t stopped yielding uncannily compelling results. On his first album for a major label, his ability to create a sound that feels at once magical and lived-in remains remarkable, like whole histories of folk and rock music are expressing themselves through this one chill guy. Whether you’ve been riding with him for years or you’re thinking of joining up today, Headlights is an album that won’t make you regret that choice. —S.V.L.

21	GOLLIWOG	billy woods

> Each song on billy woods’ GOLLIWOG unfolds with the knowledge that death, or perhaps a fate worse than, waits behind every corner. His characters stare up at planes as bomb hatches swing open, or wake from nightmares, only to find themselves trapped in coffins. They’re threatened by vampires, soulless record executives, corrupt politicians, abusive fathers, and the American military apparatus, and woods cleverly constructs the moments where they know it’s all fucked. He’s approached this subject matter throughout his career, but rarely sustains that bullet-sweating, white knuckle tension for an entire LP. Here, he writes like an amalgam of Shirley Jackson, Mariana Enríquez, and Frank B. Wilderson III, crafting a speculative opus titled mere degrees from our reality. It’s harrowing and horrific, the cathartic laughter after the jump scare catching in our throats. –Dash Lewis

17  GOLLIWOG    billy woods

> Billy Woods rose out of the Brooklyn rap underground as a virtuoso poet, one of hip-hop’s most independent and brilliant minds over the past two decades. On Golliwog, he goes for an album full of horror stories. It’s a densely poetic, totally masterful tour de force where Woods lets his expansive imagination run loose in a dystopia where the real-life monsters are scarier than anything he could invent. Golliwog is a horror show that demands — and replays — close attention. But it’s an album that offers no comfort — for Woods, the monsters are everywhere, and survival means keeping on your toes. —R.S.

18	Fancy That	PinkPantheress

> Like many girls who came of age in the aughts and early 2010s, PinkPantheress spent plenty of time reading fan fiction. A classic Pink track feels like it could have been lifted straight from a self-insert, the kind where the protagonist meticulously shaves her entire body on the off chance that she’s invited backstage to hook up with the band. On her second album, Fancy That, she’s evolved from brooding over unrequited love atop breakbeats to embracing a much more flirtatious and forward tone. “Come talk to me. Do you want sex with me?” she whispers on “Tonight.” You can almost picture her twirling a fluffy pastel gel pen, feet kicking in the air, as she writes in her glittery Girl Tech Password-protected journal.

23  Fancy That  PinkPantheress

> Pinkpantheress takes a quick spin through the club on the 20-minute Fancy That, drawing energy from turn-of-the century British bangers, and the sort of brazen sampling that made hip-hop and dance music so exciting back in the day. Basement Jaxx disco-funk stomper “Romeo” gets flipped on “Girl Like Me,” and Jaxx DNA appears elsewhere on the mixtape. Elsewhere, Fancy That chops up Jessica Simpson and Panic! at the Disco and teams Victoria Walker up with “indie-sleaze” brat the Dare on “Stateside.” The upshot is nine crispy song nuggets that don’t overstay or overshare. —W.H.

16	LUX	Rosalía

> In Gravity and Grace, the philosopher and Catholic mystic Simone Weil writes of God’s love as fundamentally unknowable; an abstract totality who loves us but whom we can only embrace in the dark. Rosalía’s album LUX is a modern inquiry into that darkness, a sacred and profane fusion of pop and classical music that approaches timeless spiritual questions through the lens of a modern seeker. Guided by a rogues’ gallery of female saints and holy women, the singer probes into love, desire, and eternity, sampling a broad palette of genres and tongues to illuminate distinct aspects of the soul. Even if her resolve to cast off her Jimmy Choos in “Sauvignon Blanc” isn’t as mortifying as anything Teresa of Avila or Catherine of Siena got up to (don’t look it up), the gift of LUX is the little light Rosalía shines on life’s greatest mysteries. –Harry Tafoya

3   LUX ROSALÍA

> Rosalía has proven herself to be pop’s most provocative chaos agent, and Lux sounds like absolutely nothing else in music right now. Her irreverence is what makes the album such a shock to the system — she’s drawing from the greats but going for Mozart with baddie energy, Bach with a blunt in the mouth. Ultimately, the album succeeds because every song is deeply thought out and wildly heartfelt, tying back to heady ideas of what the hell we’re all doing here. She contends with pain and loss, anger and grief, sex and desire, love and worship, while trying to get a better understanding of who she is, the way she loves, and the spiritual forces that move her. —J.L.

12	Addison	Addison Rae

> Addison Rae overcame being the most popular TikTok dancer to become one of the less popular new pop stars, and as soon as we realized she meant it, we were all in. I saw her come out at Madison Square Garden with Charli XCX in the fevered months post-BRAT and she did not hit that note, but literally no one cares anymore because Addison is this year’s most stylishly indexed and tonally refined pure pop album. “Diet Pepsi” is irresistible. “High Fashion” is camp. Happiness equals one shitty pair of wired earbuds and one cigarette. Louisiana’s sweetheart and her Scandinavian pop wizards (production duo Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd) make it look so easy: no features, no skips, no deluxe editions. This is how It Girls are born. –Anna Gaca


12  Addison Addison Rae

> When Addison Rae was ascending on TikTok with viral dances and beauty deals, the millions that followed her may have never anticipated where she would be five years later. But Rae has become an expert at reminding people to expect the unexpected. Her self-titled debut is energetic and inventive, a true pop fan’s pop album. With touches of Ray of Light Madonna and In the Zone Britney Spears, Addison is meant to get you moving. But it’s the moments she lets you in that help the album shine more brightly, like the nods to family discord and anxiety that peek out of “Times Like These” and “Headphones On.” —B.S.
