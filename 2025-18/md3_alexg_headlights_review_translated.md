# Alex Giannascoli（Alex G）《Headlights》专辑乐评翻译与解析

## 原始英文文本
> Alex Giannascoli was one of the first and finest acts to break through in the 2010s by posting his home-recorded music straight to Bandcamp, and his tried-and-true methods haven't stopped yielding uncannily compelling results. On his first album for a major label, his ability to create a sound that feels at once magical and lived-in remains remarkable, like whole histories of folk and rock music are expressing themselves through this one chill guy. Whether you've been riding with him for years or you're thinking of joining up today, Headlights is an album that won't make you regret that choice. —S.V.L.
