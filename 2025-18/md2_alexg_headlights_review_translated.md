# Alex G《Headlights》专辑乐评翻译与解析

## 原始英文文本
> On Headlights, Alex G surveys the iconography of his past work from the other side of 30 years old and a major label deal. In the process, he recovers the pieces of himself that had always loomed beneath the surface to construct his first true self-portrait. The lifelong Philly resident writes explicitly from his own perspective, putting the idealistic dreams of his youth and the character sketches of his old records in conversation with his present self: a new father and reluctant "career" musician. It's a well-navigated turn toward greater vulnerability that comes alongside his prettiest songwriting yet. And, fortunately, his newfound maturity hasn't stifled his eccentric impulses. "Bounce Boy" fully realizes his past experiments with Auto-Tune and hyperpop-adjacent electronica, while tracks on the record's final stretch look to The Muppet Movie and Vince Guaraldi's Peanuts scores to generate Headlights' most tender moments. On "Is It Still You in There?" a children's choir asks the titular question as jazzy keys float by. Despite the world-weariness and disillusionment that come with growing older, Alex G is still the same dreamer that he's always been, with glimmers of optimism and awe beckoning around every corner of the record. –Jude Noel
